# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict rainfall patterns using machine learning techniques.
The model is trained on historical rainfall and weather-related features to analyze and forecast rainfall behavior across regions.

## Objectives

* Perform data preprocessing and cleaning
* Explore rainfall patterns through EDA
* Train multiple machine learning models
* Evaluate model performance
* Identify important rainfall features

## Models Used

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regressor
* Decision Tree Regressor

## Key Features Considered

* Historical Rainfall
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Atmospheric Pressure
* Wind Speed
* Seasonal Indicators
